        Marcus Aurelius, called <strong>the Philosopher</strong>, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roman emperor</a> from 161 to 180. He was adopted by Antoninus
        Pius,
        whose daughter Faustina he married and whom he and his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus, succeeded. He ruled with
        Lucius until Lucius' death in 169, and with his son by Faustina, Commodus, from 177. He was the last of the
        rulers traditionally known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty#Five_Good_Emperors"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Good Emperors</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was a practitioner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stoicism</a>.
        His personal philosophical writings, which later came to be called
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meditations</a></em>,
        are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. They have been
        seen as one of the greatest works of philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        During his reign, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roman
          Empire</a> defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in the East; Marcus' general Avidius
        Cassius sacked the Parthian capital Ctesiphon in 164. In central Europe, Marcus fought the Marcomanni, Quadi,
        and
        Sarmatians with success during the Marcomannic Wars, although the threat of the Germanic peoples began to
        represent a troubling reality for the Empire. Persecution of Christians is said to have increased during his
        reign.
      </p>

      <p>
        His death in 180 is seen as an end to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Pax Romana</a>. The increasing instability in the West that followed has
        traditionally been seen as the beginning of the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire.
